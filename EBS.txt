lsblk                           disks and partitions


create a volume 

make sure that the volume and the instance are on the same AZ 

attach the volume to the instance 



sudo file -s /dev/xvdf          to check the format of the disks

sudo mkfs -t ext4               to format the disk 

sudo mkdir /mnt/2nd-volume/     new directory under mnt

mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/2nd-volume mounting the new volume

lsblk                           to check the disk again

df                              to show the files related to filesystem


Under Amazon/EC2/Volumes, change the created volume's size to 4GB.

lsblk                           check the new volume if it is turned to 4GB

df -h                           to check the new disk file system, you will see the disk as 2GB

sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdf        to resize the new disk

df -h                           to check the new disk again 

sudo reboot now                 to reboot the instance

After reboot, we need to mount the disk again.

sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/2nd-volume/   to mount the same disk again

Under Amazon/EC2/Volumes, create a new volume of 2GB.

lsblk                           check the new disk.

df -h                           check the file system again.

sudo fdisk -l                   formation status of the current disks.

sudo fdisk /dev/xvdg            to create a partition in the new volume which is xvdg 

entered in the fdisk menu

n                               for new partition

p                               for primary

1-4                             partition no

First sector size: Default size 2048

Last sector size: 2100000

Let's create another partition 

n                               for new partition

p                               for primary

2-4                             partition no

First sector:                   choose the default as this is the second partition 

Last sector:                    choose the default as this is the second partition 

w                               will save the changes and quit.

We need to format these partitions.

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdg1                    formatted the first partition

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdg2                    formatted the second partition

sudo mkdir /mnt/3rd-volume-part1/               creating mount folder under /mnt folder   

sudo mkdir /mnt/3rd-volume-part2/               creating mount folder under /mnt folder   

sudo mount /dev/xvdg1 /mnt/3rd-volume-part1     mounting first partition to the /mnt/folder 

sudo mount /dev/xvdg2 /mnt/3rd-volume-part2     mounting first partition to the /mnt/folder 

We now get back to Amazon/EC2/Volume and changed this partitioned volume size from 2GB to 3GB.

sudo growpart /dev/xvdg 2

sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdg2

cd /etc

sudo cp fstab fstab.bak                         created a backup 

edit fstab file with an editor

/dev/xvdf                            /mnt/2nd-volume     ext4    defaults,nofail   0   0
/dev/xvdg1                           /mnt/3rd-volume-part1 ext4  defaults,nofail   0   0
/dev/xvdg2                           /mnt/3rd-volume-part2 ext4  defaults,nofail   0   0
