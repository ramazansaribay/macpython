ipconfig            for windows. configuration of the current network.
ifconfig            for linux. configuration of current network
iptables            for linux. Iptables  and ip6tables are used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 and IPv6 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.
nslookup            search for the ip address of the address
get_digit           detailed nslookup
mtr                 detailed traceroute
nmap                port scanner 

route add
route delete
route change
route print 

iptable and route are the most important commands for firewall

netstat             network status
tcpdump             the whole traffic on the interface.
ftp                 file transfer protocols.
ftp get
ftp put

telnet              to connect to a remote host. unsecure.
