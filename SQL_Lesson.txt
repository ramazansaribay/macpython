SELECT student FROM students_class;
SELECT DISTINCT student FROM students_class;            Writes the repeating lines just for one.
SELECT * FROM students_class;                           Shows all rows.

SELECT * FROM students_class WHERE grade > 90;          shows the output of the function.

SELECT * FROM students_class LIMIT 3;                   shows the first 3 rows.

Let's combine them.

SELECT * FROM students_class WHERE grade > 70 LIMIT 2;  show the first 2 rows, grades bigger than 70.


SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name(s) ASC|DESC;         orders by the givven column as ascending or descending.
SELECT * FROM tracks ORDER BY name ASC | DESC;                          default is ASC and it can be changed to DESC.
