GLOBAL AND LOCAL VAR 
x = 10
def my_x():
    print(x)

x = 10
def my_x()
    x += 1
    print(x)        THIS WONT WORK. YOU CAN NOT CHANGE A GLOBAL IN LOCAL. TRY THE NEXT INSTEAD.

x = 10
def my_x():
    global x 
    x += 1
    print(x)        THIS WILL WORK.



FLOAT DATA TYPE MANIPULATION
amount = 3
des_amount = ("$%.2f" % amount)
